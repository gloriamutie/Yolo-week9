## Project Description
Creating an about virtual machine using vagrant and deploying yolo app using ansible
## Project Setup Instruction
Installation of ansible, virtual-box, vagrant, Docker, Terraform

## Known Bugs
`
Regrettably, the hashicorp/var provider and the bmatcuk/vagrant provider might not currently be accessible on your operating platform. These providers are frequently employed with Vagrant and might lack official compatibility with the Apple Silicon architecture (M1 chip).

Consequently, executing Vagrant with Ubuntu Server on an M1-equipped Mac might pose difficulties due to the absence of official provider endorsement. Nonetheless, it remains possible to utilize Vagrant independently of Terraform in order to set up the virtual machine.
